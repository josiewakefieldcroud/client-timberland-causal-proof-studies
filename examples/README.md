# Examples

This folder contains a few examples showcasing how to use `causalinf`. 


## Usage
The tests in this folder depend on mock data found in `../tests/fixture`. To run the scripts, therefore, you'll need to set-up the following variables in an `.env` file, and save this under the project root folder:

```sh
export SRC_FOLDER=      # path to project root.
```
